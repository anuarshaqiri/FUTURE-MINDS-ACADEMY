            Dave released his debut extended play Six Paths in 2016, after the
            release of several successful singles including the grime song
            "Thiago Silva" with AJ Tracey. In the same year, Canadian rapper
            Drake premiered a remix single of Dave's song "Wanna Know" featuring
            himself on OVO Sound Radio. Dave released his second EP Game Over in
            2017. In 2018, his political song "Question Time", which directed
            criticism towards the British Government, won the Ivor Novello Award
            for Best Contemporary Song. In the same year, he released "Funky
            Friday", featuring Fredo, which became his first number-one song on
            the UK Singles Chart and his first platinum certified release.
